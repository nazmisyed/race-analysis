## Overview

The Runnerunite website provides race results for a specific event. By scraping the data from this website, we can gather information about the teams that participated in the race and analyze their performance.

## Goals

1. Scrape data: Develop a web scraping script to extract relevant data from the Runnerunite website. This includes information about the teams, their finishing times, and any other relevant details.

2. Analyze team winning: Analyze the performance of different teams in the race. Determine which teams achieved the highest rankings and identify any patterns or trends.

3. Finish time distribution: Analyze the distribution of finish times among all participants. This will help us understand the overall performance of the race and identify any outliers or exceptional performances.
